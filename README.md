# Internship Summary — AI/ML Intern @ Persistent Systems (May–Aug 2025)

This repository documents the work I completed during my 4-month internship at **Persistent Systems** as an **AI/ML Intern**.  
The focus of my work was designing systems that make large and complex codebases easier to understand and interact with using AI.

---

## 📌 Overview

During my internship, I contributed to building **repository-aware AI systems** with the goal of helping developers work faster and smarter.  
The core themes of my work were:

- Extracting meaningful knowledge from large repositories  
- Assisting with **bug fixing** and **test case generation**  
- Creating summaries that make projects easier to navigate  
- Exploring ways to analyze **legacy systems (COBOL)**  

---

## 🔑 Key Contributions

### 1. Repository-Specific Help System
- Developed a system that allows AI to respond with **repository-aware answers**.  
- Applied this to tasks like bug fixing and automated test case suggestions.  

### 2. Data Preprocessing & Knowledge Extraction
- Designed a pipeline to **filter, segment, and prioritize** important information in large codebases.  
- Ensured the extracted knowledge was **high-quality and useful for AI models**.  

### 3. Repository Summarization
- Built a multi-level framework to generate summaries at the **file, directory, and project** levels.  
- These summaries helped both AI models and developers understand the structure and purpose of a project quickly.  

### 4. Instruction–Answer Dataset Creation
- Created high-quality **instruction–answer datasets** in categories like bug fixing and test case generation.  
- Helped shape evaluation methods to measure AI model performance in realistic development scenarios.  

### 5. COBOL Understanding Prototype
- Designed a prototype that explains **COBOL programs** in structured, human-readable reports.  
- Combined parsing techniques with AI explanations to make legacy systems easier to understand.

## 🧭 Internship Journey

- **Month 1** → Built the foundation: filtering, preprocessing, and initial summarization.  
- **Month 2** → Added prioritization methods; began creating datasets.  
- **Month 3** → Worked on fine-tuning experiments and evaluation frameworks.  
- **Month 4** → Built the COBOL prototype and finalized reporting/documentation.

## 💡 Key Learnings

- **Data quality > data size** for AI model improvements.  
- Smart **prioritization and pruning** make AI more reliable on large projects.  
- Summarization reduces AI **hallucinations** and improves trustworthiness.  
- Legacy code requires **hybrid methods** that mix classical parsing with AI reasoning.  

---

## 📈 Impact

- Developed a **robust pipeline** for repository understanding.  
- Authored **realistic datasets** that improved AI performance.  
- Prototyped an **AI-assisted legacy code explainer**.  
- Contributed to the foundation of a **repository-aware AI assistant**.
